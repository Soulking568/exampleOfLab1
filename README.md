Assignment README

This repository contains solutions for 10 programming problems. The problems are related to fundamental programming concepts and algorithms, including finding minimum and average of an array, checking whether a number is prime, finding factorial and nth Fibonacci number using recursion, finding binomial coefficients, and calculating GCD using Euclidean Algorithm.

The solutions are written in Python, and for each problem, a function is implemented that takes input as per the problem statement and returns the output as expected. The functions are named according to the problem number, e.g., problem1() for the first problem.

The README file for each problem contains the problem statement, input format, and output format. It also provides an example of input and output. Additionally, the README file for problem 3 onwards mentions that the solution requires the use of recursion.

How to Use

To use the solutions, you can copy the code for the respective problem into your Python environment or run it as a standalone file. Each function can be called with input as per the problem statement, and it will return the expected output.

Future Improvements

These solutions can be improved by adding more error handling and edge cases to handle input validation. Additionally, the solutions can be implemented in different programming languages, making it more accessible for individuals who are not proficient in Python.

Conclusion

This assignment helped to practice fundamental programming concepts and algorithms. Additionally, it helped to learn how to implement solutions to programming problems using recursion.
